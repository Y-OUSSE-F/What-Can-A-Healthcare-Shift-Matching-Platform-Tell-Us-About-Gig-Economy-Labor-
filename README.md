## **Overview**  
This repository contains a research case study analyzing the labor dynamics of a healthcare shift-matching platform, referred to as **"Health-Exchange"** (a pseudonym for anonymity). The study examines platform data from **July 2024 to January 2025**, exploring how effectively healthcare facilities meet their staffing needs and comparing Health-Exchange's marketplace trends with broader gig economy models like Uber.  

The findings indicate that Health-Exchange's user base currently faces challenges due to **an oversupply of workers**, creating an imbalance where employers hold more leverage. It is a market which heavily favors employers. This leads to **lower pay rates, decreased worker engagement, and inefficient allocation of labor**. To ensure sustainable growth, platforms like Health-Exchange must balance supply and demand, focus on high-talent density areas, and refine user engagement strategies.

- **Flexible Scheduling:** Professionals can select shifts that align with their availability.  
- **Competitive Pay:** Compensation rates fluctuate based on demand, location, and time.
